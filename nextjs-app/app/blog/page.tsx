        Why Your Resume Isn’t Working (And How to Fix It)
      </h1>
      <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mb-10">Published July 10, 2025</p>

      <p className="mb-6">
        You’ve been applying to jobs for weeks—maybe months—but you’re not
        hearing back. It’s easy to assume it’s the job market, or that companies
        just aren’t hiring. But more often than not, the problem is your resume.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-600">
        1. You’re Not Beating the Bots
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Most companies use Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) to scan resumes
        before a human ever sees them. If your resume doesn’t use the right
        keywords or formatting, it might get filtered out immediately. Use clean
        formatting and include relevant keywords from the job description.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-600">
        2. It’s Too Generic
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        If your resume reads like it could be sent to any company for any role,
        hiring managers will move on. Tailor your resume to each job. That
        doesn’t mean rewriting everything—just adjust your summary, job titles,
        and key bullet points to reflect what that specific company values.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-600">
        3. You’re Describing, Not Proving
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        “Responsible for” doesn’t cut it anymore. Your resume should focus on
        impact. Instead of saying “Managed social media accounts,” say
        “Increased engagement by 40% over 3 months by launching a content
        calendar.” Be specific.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-600">
        4. There’s Too Much Fluff
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Hiring managers skim resumes fast. Avoid jargon, buzzwords, or soft
        skills without examples. Phrases like “hardworking” or “team player” are
        empty unless you tie them to a result.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-600">
        5. You’re Not Prioritizing Readability
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Fancy templates with graphics might look good to you, but they confuse
        ATS systems and slow down readers. Stick to simple, clean layouts with
        clear sections, consistent formatting, and lots of white space.
      </p>

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3 text-purple-600">
        The Fix: Iterate with Feedback
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Use a tool like TrackifyJobs to parse your resume, score it for ATS
        compatibility, and see exactly where it falls short. Tweak, test, and
        repeat. A few changes could make the difference between silence and an
        interview.
